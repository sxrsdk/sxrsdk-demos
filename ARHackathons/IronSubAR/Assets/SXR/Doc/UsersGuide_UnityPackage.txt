*Unity Preparation Process and Build Instructions*


The latest binary package file for Unity applications will be released as part of SamsungXR.

  If you have old SamsungXR camera, please delete it and recreate it. 
  
- In Unity, select "Assets > Import Package > Custom Package ...", 
  find the folder containing Samsung SXR Unity Plugin, for example, 
  "SXRPlugin3.0.unitypackage", and import everything from the package.


To build Unity Project using the plugin follow the described instructions: 

- Define build platform as Android 

- Make sure option "Player Settings"/"Resolution And Presentation"/Landscape Left" is enabled

  have been prepared and your game is ready to build

- The settings of main camera are adjustable depending on app's need. Otherwise, recommended to set
  as Clear Flags: Skybox, Culling Mask: Everything, Camera: checked

- The plugin has namespaces, called Sxr and SxrInternal. Applications may need to add using directive, 
  using namespace Sxr, to allow access to the pluin’s scripts at code level. SxrInternal is usually 
  for plugin codes and can be changed anytime in the future without backward compatibility.
