API notes:
API was not too hard, but it was a bit inconvenient to implement ISXRControllerTriggerHandler, ISXRControllerGyroHandler,
ISXRControllerTouchpadHandler,ISXRControllerTouchpadButtonHandler,ISXRControllerVolumeHandler,
ISXRControllerBackHandler,ISXRControllerHomeHandler to work with the controller and need add objects to scene etc.
I think it would be easier in Unity to have static methods like GearController.GetTouchpad() like how the Input.* methods
work in the Unity API.  Another way might be to have a ControllerState struct that you can get all at once.

Side note:
This hackathon was a bit harder since my laptops got water damage due to a leak in my bag on the way here.
As a result my space key doesn't work, please excuse the messy formatting!
